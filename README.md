# Castalia_with_ACArch
This repository is my master's degree project, which was done in the Federal Santa Catarina University, Brazil. 
The project developed a new architecture, named ACArch, for Wireless Sensor Networks formation. 
The communication protocol used is based on IEEE 802.15.4 / ZigBee standarts and works upon a cluster-tree topology. 

For analyzing the performance of the proposed architecture, the Castalia simulator was utilized. 
The architecture was evaluated through many aspects, such as: scalability, coverage, consumed energy, end-to-end delays and success rate.
The simulation results showed that ACArch forms robust and efficient networks.
